# Wato Server Status Application

### Deploy

The monitoring application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). The following application was build with node v12+ and yarn 1.19.1

Install the dependencies and deploy application

```sh
$ cd client && yarn install
$ cd ../server && yarn install
$ yarn server &
$ yarn client &
```

Deploying process will be improved in further iterations. Quick hack so we can get application set up as fast as possible.
